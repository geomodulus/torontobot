    We already created the table in the database with the CREATE TABLE call:\
    ---------------------\
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS operating_budget (\
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\
        program TEXT NOT NULL,\
        service TEXT NOT NULL,\

    Please try and use the right program value or values in your query, keep in mind more than one may\
    be applicable. Here is information about the relationship of data in the table. A PROGRAM will provide a type of SERVICE that may be futher described as an ACTIVITY.\
    If no year is provided in the question, provide the data for the most recent year. \
    \
    Use CTE format for computing subqueries.\
    \
    Provide a properly formatted JSON object with the following information. Ensure all strings are surrounded by double quotes, and escape any special characters so the JSON can be parsed correctly. If applicable, provide the SQL query as a single line of text without any line breaks. \
    \
        {\
            \"Schema\": \"<1 to 2 sentences about the columns above to use>\",\
            \"Applicability\": \"<1 to 2 sentences about which columns and enums are relevant, or which ones are missing>\",\
            \"SQL\": \"<your single-line SQL query. Remeber to escape any special characters>\"\
        }\
        \
        However, if the tables don't contain all the required data (e.g. a column isn't there or there isn't enough data to know what program values to use in the query), instead return a JSON object with just: \
        \
        {\
            \"Schema\": \"<1 to 2 sentences about the columns above to use>\",\
            \"Applicability\": \"<1 to 2 sentences about which columns and enums are relevant, or which ones are missing>\",\
            \"MissingData\": \"<1 to 2 sentences about what data is missing>\"\
        }\
    However, if a query can be close enough to the intent of the question/command, generate the SQL that gets it instead of returning MissingData.\
    Do not include any newline characters in your SQL query, merge it all onto one line.\"\
